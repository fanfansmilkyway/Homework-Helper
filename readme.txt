Q & A:
What's Homework Helper?
Homework Helper is a useful tool to help students manage and statistic their summer / winter holiday homework.
How to use it?
First of all, create the homework set. For one homework entry you need to input: Entry, Difficulty(difficulty to finish one unit), Amount(the number of units). For example, one of your summer holiday homework is "Reading 20 passages". And your input can be: Entry:Reading 20 passages, Difficulty:3(suggestion range is 0~10), Amount:20. Then you can update the homework set. Suppose that you finish reading 10 passages today, next to do is to update it to homework set. Finally statistic the homework set, the program will show you the completed percentage of the whole homework set. 
Why to input Difficulty?
When statistic the homework set, program will do weighted calculation. The difficulty of a homework bigger and its importance is higher. It makes statistics more accurate.
